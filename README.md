# Algerian Sign Language 3D-Avatar

## Overview
This project is an **Automated Arabic Algerian Sign Language (ALSL) Translation System** that utilizes **3D avatar technology** to translate Arabic text into dynamic ALSL gestures. The system is designed to improve accessibility and communication for the **deaf community** in Algeria. 

The translation engine relies on:
- **HamNoSys (Hamburg Notation System)** for encoding ALSL gestures.
- **SiGML (Signing Gesture Markup Language)** for generating animated sign language.
- **CWASA (CWA Signing Avatars)** for rendering the 3D avatar’s sign language animations.

The system currently supports a dictionary of **417 ALSL words** with a certified accuracy rate of **75.53%**.

## Features
✅ **Real-time ALSL translation** from Arabic text to 3D avatar gestures.  
✅ **Lexicon of ALSL gestures**, built using HamNoSys and validated by sign language experts.  
✅ **Web-based interface** for accessibility and ease of use.  
✅ **Integration with CWASA avatar rendering** for accurate sign representation.
